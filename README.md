# Heaven's Harp

Author: Greg Loose

Design: Heaven's Harp is a rhythm / action game where you control a magical harp that has fallen from the sky onto a deserted island, attracting hordes of treasure hunters seeking to lay claim to your power. Play music to the beat, choosing from four songs with unique effects to protect yourself from the invaders and survive as long as you can.
